# Chat app
This is a client-server application that I wrote to learn network programming. Client only uses FLTK as GUI library and server uses SQLite database to store user info and [SHA1 library](https://github.com/vog/sha1/tree/master) for password encryption. 
Also I wrote a small network utils library for both the client and server.

To summarize what I learned and achieved:
- How to use Unix sockets for network
- How to use SQLite database and intergrate it into a program
- SHA1 encyption
- Learned how to encapsulate data to transmit it over a network
